# About Me
Hi, I'm Jiaqi Yao, a Junior from Shanghai, who majored in Economics at DKU. I am currently interested in the interaction between GAI, large language models, and economics theories. I am aiming to accumulate more computer science skills to make interdisciplinary approaches in the field of economics that keep pace with the developing technological society.
## Interests
- **[Microeconomics]:** I am curious about the more individual-related perspectives of the economic world, focusing on the more behavioral parts such as how individual pursues rationality and how the market reaches equilibrium.
- **[GAI]:** I have a strong interest on how people train machines and come up with machine learning mechanisms. Personally, I believe those are significant tools to reach empirical researches with advanced technology and larger datasets.
- **[Game theory]:** Current game theories are limited to bounded rationality and imperfect information problems that occurs in reality, and better interactions with AI may be a solution to this phenomenon.
