# About Me
Hi, I'm Jiaqi Yao, a Junior from Shanghai, who majored in Economics at DKU. I am currently interested in the interaction between GAI, large language models, and economics theories. I am aiming to accumulate more computer science skills to make interdisciplinary approaches in the field of economics that keep pace with the developing technological society.
## Interests
- **[Microeconomics]:** I am curious about the more individual-related perspectives of the economic world, focusing on the more behavioral parts such as how individual pursues rationality and how the market reaches equilibrium.
- **[GAI]:** I have a strong interest on how people train machines and come up with machine learning mechanisms. Personally, I believe those are significant tools to reach empirical researches with advanced technology and larger datasets.
- **[Game theory]:** Current game theories are limited to bounded rationality and imperfect information problems that occur in reality, and better interactions with AI may be a solution to this phenomenon.

## About this Repo
This repository is used for posting the Answers to Problem Set 1 of COMSCI/ECON206 Computational Microeconomics instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at DKU. The problems are mainly focused on the interdisciplinary approach between CS and ECON, that includes both theoretical parts and practical parts. For the theoretical parts, I provided some insights into the interaction between human nature and AI, like their separate features and how they can provide a better future together. For practical parts, I provided some works implemented using platforms such as oTree and Pettingzoo, to show the current limitations of technology and game theory, proposing better solutions that can be done in the future.
