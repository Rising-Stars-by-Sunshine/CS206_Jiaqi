# Questions and relevant answers

**Question 1**

**When computer science meets economics**: Who do you truly want to become? Pick one of your favorite Nobel Prize winners (https://www.nobelprize.org/) and Turing Award winners (https://amturing.acm.org/). How do you want to contribute to the intersection of the two north stars to advance human civilizations? 

**Answer 1**
My favorite Nobel Prize winner is Daniel Kahneman, who integrated cognitive psychology into the study of economics to understand humanity's decision-making under uncertainty. (Fr채ngsmyr, 2019) Though applying psychology to economics may sound regular and should be taken for granted nowadays, the very first concept of behavioral economics was innovative, without a doubt. Just as the interdisciplinary approach between CS and economy that we are now putting effort into, setting up a cross-section approach needs a strong sense of how traditional theories could be biased in reality and a firm root to doubt what has already been taken for granted at the time. As Kahneman himself said, he "has few memories of having changed my mind under adversarial pressure" (Fr채ngsmyr, 2019), but finally proved himself right against the "unrealistic conception of rationality." (Fr채ngsmyr, 2019) Alan Kay, the 2003 Turin Prize winner, created the graphical interfaces and the Smalltalk programming language with his team, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language. (Barnes 2019) His cross-century idea shocked me a lot. How could a small computing system be generated in mind in 1970, when there was no concept of a notebook computer? Somehow, like Kahneman, they both had super innovative minds and a sense of putting effort into stuff that few people cared about at that time. 
I want to contribute by integrating generative AI into learning market behavior, using a large language model to help me test traditional economic theories that, as Daniel did, figure out more "unrealistic concepts of rationality. (Fr채ngsmyr, 2019) We live in a complex world, and that huge information gap always leads different types of people to act differently. For instance, research conducted by Susan et al. (2022) found the pervasive nature of information asymmetry across various domains, not just in investments. They suggest that this information gap would cause people's lack of trust, market uncertainty, and diversified risk premium, which may cause irrationality in investments, businesses, and other aspects of society. The situation is spread out, and it's hard to analyze such complex and large data without the computer; generative AI may be a way out due to its deep and self-learning characteristics. By updating and improving the original economic theories, the newly generated theory would better fit the fast-developing and technological society.

**Question 2**

**CS&Econ for a Better Future**: How do you perceive the synergy between computer science and economics as a catalyst for steering innovation toward a brighter future? Please present a foundational assertion, followed by multiple specific instances that support your claim, including a reference to a topic discussed at the colloquium on Friday, March 22.

**Question 3**

**Beyond CS & Econ**: How are aspects of human nature, like bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies, such as generative AI, reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts? Additionally, how might this interplay be perceived and conceptualized distinctively from current models? Address this inquiry by drawing upon the literature covered in our lectures and supplementary scholarly works, ensuring to include in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography.
