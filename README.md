# About Me
Hi, I'm Jiaqi Yao, a Junior from Shanghai, who majored in Economics at DKU. I am currently interested in the interaction between GAI, large language models, and economics theories. I am aiming to accumulate more computer science skills to make interdisciplinary approaches in the field of economics that keep pace with the developing technological society.
## Interests
- **[microeconomics]:** I am curious about the more individual-related perspectives of the economic world, focusing on the more behavioral parts such as how individual pursues rationality and how market reaches equilibrium.
- **[Interest 2]:** [Short Description]
